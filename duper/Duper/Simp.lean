  The `List Clause` are clauses to be removed
  The `List (Clause × Proof)` are the result clauses
  - Clauses that are to be removed will be replaced by clauses introduced via `yieldClause`
  - An important invariant is that the i-th clause produced via `yieldClause` must have been produced by the i-th clause in the result list.
    This invariant ensures that we can figure out the correct set of generatingAncestors for each new clause.
